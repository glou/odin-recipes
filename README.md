# odin-recipes

This is the first project inside the new HTML/CSS content at The Odin Project.

Although I've already went through it, it was the older version/format, which had, in my opinion, critical
issues. So, to review/solidify the mentioned content, I'm doing the reformulated section - and, of course,
the related projects.

- 2021, September, 22: put some CSS to practice the lesson. It isn't pretty, just some rules.
- 2021, September, 19: created this repo for the first project.
- 2021, September, 19: started TOP in 2021, August; came back to the HTML/CSS, now in its new format.
