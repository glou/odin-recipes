        <p>A croque monsieur is a hot sandwich made with ham and cheese. The dish originated in French cafés and bars as a quick snack.</p>
        <p>The name comes from the French words croque ("bite”) and monsieur ("mister").</p>

        <h3 class="subsection">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 pound shredded Gruyere cheese, divided</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>16 slices white sandwich bread</li>
            <li>½ pound thinly sliced ham</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="subsection">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place bread slices on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan. Add flour; cook and stir until paste-like, about 2 minutes. Slowly add milk, while stirring. Cook and stir until sauce is thickened, about 3 minutes. Turn off the burner and stir in 1/2 cup Gruyere cheese, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Toast bread slices in the preheated oven, keeping an eye on them so they don't burn, 3 to 4 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Remove bread from the oven and top 8 slices with ham. Sprinkle 1/2 of the remaining Gruyere over the ham, then top with remaining 8 bread slices. Pour Bechamel sauce over each sandwich and sprinkle with remaining Gruyere.</li>
            <li>Return to the oven and bake for 5 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil until cheese is nicely toasted but not burned, 1 to 2 minutes. Enjoy while hot.</li>            
        </ol>
